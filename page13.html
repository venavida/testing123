                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><br>&nbsp;My SOCIT fest experience was okay. What I enjoyed the most was that there were no classes and all we had to do was attend seminars and different talks. I really saw how much time and effort my classmates put into organizing the whole event. My classmates are members of JPCS and JISSA so they’re pretty much the ones responsible for everything that transpired last week. Hats off to them for making the SOCIT Fest successful. 
<br>
<br>	I’m not a part of any organization at the moment, but I do plan to join APC Band. I’m not an organizer too so I guess my only contribution was moral support and my attendance during the events. 
<br>
<br>As a participant my favorite event was of course, SOCIT Night. There was the pageant, live bands, etc. It was nice seeing different members of the SOCIT community come together for a night to remember. I think if there’s one thing that needs to be improved, it’s the scheduling of SOCIT Sportsfest games. Our team’s game had to be suddenly changed from afternoon to morning which caused a bit of inconvenience. This was due to another team having a conflict of schedule. I think it shouldn’t be our problem if they signed up to play but can’t make it to their game. 
<br><br>I expect that next year, members of the SOCIT community will be as enthusiastic as this year and prepare a lot of events for us. Maybe we could add more surprises and things that we haven’t done before. Below is a picture of one of our seminars. &nbsp;<br></p>
